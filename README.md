App Features **

In this mini-project , Iâ€™ve built Tasty Kitchens Swiggy clone Responsive food delivery app with functionality like,


The app should fetch data from an internal server using a class component and display the data using component lifecycle methods, routing concepts, authentication, and authorization. Additionally, the app should be responsive and include a login route, home route, specific restaurant details route, cart route, and a logout button. The home route should have a navbar with the application title, logo, and buttons for Home, Cart, and Logout. The route should also include carousel images with offer details and popular restaurants. The sort by icon should allow users to sort the list of restaurants based on their ratings. When a user clicks on a restaurant in the list, it should open a new page with the respective restaurant details. The cart route should allow users to view their selected food items, each food item quantity, and price of each food item on a separate page. Users should be able to increase or decrease the quantity of each food item, and the price should increase or decrease accordingly. The app should also have a page not found route and store cart items in local storage so that they persist even after the app is refreshed.
